		"narrative": "The Tica is a premium directional splitboard board that also rides perfectly backwards, built to work just as well in freestyle terrain as it is in deep powder. Designed with a blunt-shaped nose for superior float and the all-mountain feel with a wider, tapered and square-shaped tail for a longer effective edge while keeping superior float and backwards Maneuverability. The special camber profile with its inlays around the nose and tail allows you to put pressure where it’s needed for maximum load and quick pop back. Made with a premium light wood core blended with a Polyamide Bio Beans topsheet for scratch resistance, carbon inlays for recovery and aluminum tip and tail protectors for durability. While the Karakoram ultra-clip 2.0 and tip-locks hold the board together perfectly. Added to that is the Scando Grip technology with 3-extra contact points on the edges for maximum edge-hold and superior bite on hard pack and icy conditions. With a fast and more durable sintered base that requires less maintenance. This combined with the flex and blend of premium materials gives the board a playful and poppy feel yet incredible stability at higher speeds. If you only choose one board for everything, this is it.",
