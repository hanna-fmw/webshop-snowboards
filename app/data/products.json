The nose tip is designed slightly longer than the tail for magical float when you’re out in backcountry. The twin in-between the contact points on the effective riding edge means you won’t feel any difference going down the mountain both ways. The flat camber makes the board poppy but still playful enough to jib or put down a solid nose press on rail. While the Scando Grip technology with 3-extra contact points on the edges for maximum edge-hold and superior bite on hard pack and icy conditions. In combination with the premium light wood core and special materials throughout, this is the freestyle-based board you can also take outside of the piste and still have a great time.",
